# QuitGame
Every once in a while we would go "Hm I should play Minecraft".

But think about it more, do you *really* want to play?  
How about the infinite amount of things you can do during this period?  
What about your computer, can it really handle Minecraft and does it like you playing Minecraft?  
Do you simply had enough of poisonous potato?

Introducing a way to _not_ play Minecraft:

This mod achieves it's goal by removing all button except the Quit Game button, allowing you to not play Minecraft!

**"Um actually..."**  
Don't worry! Whether you are indecisive or you crave for more games, there's something for you as well!  
If you can re-arrange the letter in the splash text to start with "start", "menu", "play" and "poison", you *get to be in the game*, how incredible.

For gamers, that is 65% more game per game! (Don't get the right letter? Better luck next time!)
